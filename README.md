## <a name='Concept of Layer   '>Concept of Layer
Because of the limited number of keys on this tiny keyboard, there are many normal keys like characters or symbols and media keys that we want the keyboard to type out. By default I have set 3 layers on this keyboard, by pressing the layer toggle keys we can enter and exit the layer, at the same time the backlight under the 4 big button keys work as indicator for the current layer number. You can find more Information about it under [Backlight/LED control  ](#-backlightled-control---)
When we power the keyboard on, we are at Layer 1: the QWERTY layer. By pressing the sym key on the right under area, we can enter Layer 2: now we can type out symbol and number like # 1 2 3 which is originally marked on the keyboard. The Layer3 contains some Bluetooth operation keys and other symbols.

**Out of range problem**:  
Assume that the keyboard is connected with 2 devicesï¼šdevice 1 and device 2. If you turn on the keyboard, the keyboard will first connect with device1.  
And now you put the device 1 out of the communication range of the keyboard, then the keyboard will look for the device that is already paired, that would be the device 2 and stay connected with it.  
If you put device 1 back into the communication range, the keyboard will still stay connected with device 2, if you want to type with device 1, you need reboot the keyboard or enter layer 3 and select BT device 1.

## <a name='USB&BLE Output select  '>USB&BLE Output select   </a>
This keyboard supportes both USB and BLE output, here are some basic logics of the output select:  

By default, output is sent to BLE when both USB and BLE are connected.  

If the keyboard wasn't connected to any device or is out of the communication distance with a paired device, the output would be USB.  

Once you toggle the output between USB and BLE by entering layer 3 and hold space key for more than a half second. The keyboard will remember this if you don't make any change for more than 10 seconds.

## <a name='Backlight/LED control  '> Backlight/LED control   </a>
There are 4 LED controls on this keyboard:  
**1. Charging LED**: the read led on the left side of the keyboard indicates if the battery of the keyboard is fully charged. When the battery is being charged, the light shows like this. When the battery is fully charged, the led will go out.  
**2. Keyboard backlight**: When you power the keyboard on, the backlight of the QWERTY keyboard area will be turned on immediately. If the keyboard doesn't detect any key press for more than 30 seconds, the backlight will be turned off. Also the brightness of the backlight can be manuelly set. You can find the related action on layer 3. The brightness of the keyboard backlight is set at 40% by default. The brightness adjustment step  in percent is 10%.  
**3. Big button backlight**: The backlight of this area works as indicator of the current number of layer. At Layer 1, the backlight is turned off. At Layer2, the backlight is turned on. At Layer3, the backlight starts to breath.  
**4. Trackpad backlight**: The backlight of the trackpad works as indicator of capslock. When capslock is on, the backlight will be turned on and also the trackpad will work as scroll wheel. You can now sweep your finger on the trackpad to quickly browse a webpage or file.
